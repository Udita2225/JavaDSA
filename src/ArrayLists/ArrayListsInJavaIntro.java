        Why ArrayLIST?(Unlimited size array)
        It is same as vectors in C++
        In Java, arrays have fixed size. So we use dynamic arrays using OOP
        If the size of array gets filled, then new array of double capacity(size) is made and so on.
        This is called Dynamic Arrays
        This process is seemless(operates internally)
