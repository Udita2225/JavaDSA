    What is sorting?
    arr = {10,1,2,18,4,5}
    Sorted Order/Increasing Order/Ascending Order/Non-Decreasing Order
        = {1,2,4,5,10,18}
   Sorting basically means to arrange the given order in ascending order
   If it is asked to arrange a particular order in decreasing order then,sort from the back side
