/*
Arrays:-
Elements of Arrays can be easily accessed due to continuous memory allocation.
Limitations of Arrays which led to the creation of LinkedList
1. Fixed Size
int[] arr = new int[10];
Now we cannot increase the size of array to more than 10
Although ArrayList solves the problem but it is not the best solution
2. Insertion/Deletion
We cannot insert any element between two elements if the array is already filled.
ArrayList cause time waste and space waste.
3.Continuous Memory Allocation
