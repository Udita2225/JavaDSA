    PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS:
    *Unstructured Style - Single Block Of Code/Single Function(Only Main Function)
                          Managing the code is Difficult
                          For Smaller Tasks
    *Structured/Procedural/Functional Style - Large and Complex Task
                                              Divide into smaller sub- task
    *Object-Oriented Style

    Unstructured Style oF Programming-
    Large or Complex programs are coded as a single-continuous block of code.
    It makes the program code hardly-readable.Hence,it is difficult to modify and debug.
    *Supports limited basic data types.
    *Programs are executed sequentially and uses unstructured control statements such as goto.
    *Suitable only for small and simple tasks.
    *eg- BASIC, COBOL, FORTRAN


    Structured Style OF Programming-
    Large or Complex programs are converted into smaller blocks of code so that managing the code becomes
    easy.Producing readable code.
    Hence, it is easier to modify and debug.Supports variety of Data types.
    Programs are executed sequentially and uses structured control statements such as if/ else/for/while, etc.
    Suitable for large  and complex projects.


    These block of codes are implemented as FUNCTIONS.
    FUNCTION
    A function is a block of code o collection of statements grouped together to perform a certain task or Operation.
    However, the block of code only runs/executes when the function is called .
    eg -C, C++, Visual Basics etc.
